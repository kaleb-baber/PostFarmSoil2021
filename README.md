# PostFarmSoil2021

This data charaterizes the soil for field P-8 at the Montana State University Post Agronomy Farm. This is the site for Clain Jones' 2021 nitrogen fixation field studies.

## Sampling description

Soils were sampled on May 7, 2021 using a Giddings hydraulic soil probe. One core per site was taken at a depth of 3 feet. Cores were split into subsamples of 0-6 inches, 6-24 inches, and 24-36 inches.

## Analysis information

Soils were oven dried (50 degrees C, 72h) and ground (<5 mm) and sent to AgVise Laboratories for analysis. Nitrate was analyzed for the 0-6in and 6-24in samples and pH was only analyzed for the 0-6in samples.
